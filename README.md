# covid_model

We model universal curves of reported COVID-19 daily reported infections and related deaths using a modified epidemiological Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious- Recovered (SEIR) Model[4, 1, 5]. Using currently available data, we determine optimized constants and apply this framework to reproducing the infection and death curves for California (the state with the largest population), New York (the state with highest population density), U.S. totals, and supplimentary results for the remaining 50 states and Washington D.C.
